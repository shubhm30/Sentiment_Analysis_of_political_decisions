# Sentiment_Analysis_of_political_decisions
In this work, we explored the methodologies applied in sentiment classification over data: lexicon based, rule based and machine learning based algorithms. We used twitter as our source for data. Supervised learning algorithms like SVM and Naïve Bayes require training data sets to perform sentiment analysis task. In order to build training sets, we have used a rule based lexicon analyser that labels data before classification. A well labelled dataset in both quality as well as quantity results in an efficient classification algorithm. We used this methodology to determine the people’s sentiment for each of the decisions by the government. In our work, we have worked with the English language, however, any language can be used, provided their lexical dictionary is available.
